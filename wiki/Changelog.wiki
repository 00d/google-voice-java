#summary A list of changes in the new version of google-voice-java

New in version 1.3

     *CCalls to Google are now "spoofed" to appear as though they originate from Google Chrome.  This was done because in developing Google Voice Locations for the Android platform, it was observed that Google would not properly deliver webpage content to the API if it originated from a mobile device.  Spoofing solved the problem.  We have thus hard-coded the user-agent property to Chrome to make the behaviour consistent from every device.
